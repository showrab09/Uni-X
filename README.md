3. Using default sqlite3 database of django to maintain database throughput and response time.

**Coding Best Practices**
1. Provided proper comments anywhere required, mostly in views.
2. Followed Python PEP8 convention for consistent indentation.
3. Maintained detailed naming convention that are self explanatory.
4. Implement the continuous integration using github actions.(CI/CD)

6. The test coverage is 89% for the application.

**Functional Features**
1. Two type of user profiles- Admin and Student.
2. User authentication using email and password.
3. Student registration.
4. Stuedent management (Update and Delete).
5. Dataset creation using opencv.
6. Model training using kNN model.
7. Mark Attendance using face recognition at real time.
8. Data visualization using chartjs.
9. Export excel - attendance data using xlwt pacakage.
10. Form validation.
11. Filter attendance according to branch, session , course or date.
